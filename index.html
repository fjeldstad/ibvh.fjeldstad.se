				On the left, the available reference images are shown in the
				tree view. The camera parameters for the images are calculated
				in advance, so you do not have to input anything but the position
				and direction of the desired view that you want to render. To do
				this, simply click on the view pane (the image area to the
				right of the tree view), move the mouse cursor to rotate the
				camera and click again. At this point, the program will start
				calculating the visual hull of the object. This will probably
				take some time, and a progress bar will indicate how far along
				the process has come. When the calculations are complete, the
				image area is updated with the rendered novel view of the object.
				In this version, a depth map of the object is what is rendered.
				In the stand-alone application, it is possible to render the
				object using a simple (and buggy) implementation of
				view-dependent texture mapping which uses the information in
				the reference images to shade the rendered object.<br/><br/>
				If you are interested in knowing more about this project,
				the <a href="IBVH_src-refs_20050321.zip">source code</a> and
